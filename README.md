# 160-Zeus-GM
A light-weight (tiny mission size) Zeus game mode, based off the stock ZGM, but simpler, and all objects available and unlimited.

##Requires
[Ace3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) - If you would like a version without ACE, remove the modules in the editor yourself, or ask for one. The ACE dependency may be removed in future versions.

Should support all other mods.

##Tools:
###Disclaimer: These tools shouldn't touch anything outside the root folder, but use these at your own risk
####Requires [Armake](https://github.com/KoffeinFlummi/armake)

Setup: This will create hard symlinks from the master_docs folder to the various mission folder  

N.B: requires the releases and master_docs folder to be set as hidden because I used a lazy workaround. Like, super lazy.

Buildmission: This will update all the .pbos in the release folder.
